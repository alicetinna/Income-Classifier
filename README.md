# Income-Classifier
 The focus of our project is on predicting if the persons Income will be over 50k$ a year or under 50k$. The data used in this project was taken from the 1994 Census Database and was provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository.This is a medium sized dataset with 32561 observations and 15 attributes. Of these 15 attributes 9 are categorical and 6 are numerical.  The dataset has various information about the person like there Age, sex, gender, Occupation,  Educationlevel, hours per week, race, native country etc, these are used to predict if the person makes above or under 50k a year  This Project is completed in R and uses the packages ggplot2, plyr, dplyr, class, tree, randomForest, and ROCR. We used Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Random Forests to perform predictive modeling on the data. The quality model was Random Forests, followed by Logistic Regression and then Decision Trees. The fashions showed that  Educationwas indeed a very essential predictor in determining whether or no longer an man or woman made extra than $50,000, as well as Capital Gain, Relationship, Age, and Occupation. Race, Sex, and Working Class were consisitently marked as predictors that had the least amount of have an effect on on Income. This document will consist of the step-by-step strategies We took to discover these conclusions and explanations on the concepts.
